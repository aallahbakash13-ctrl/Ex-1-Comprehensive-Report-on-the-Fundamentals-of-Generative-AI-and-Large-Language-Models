INTRODUCTION:
Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI or Gen AI) is a rapidly advancing branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating original content such as text, images, videos, audio, and software code in response to user prompts. Unlike traditional AI systems that mainly analyze or classify data, generative AI can produce new and meaningful outputs by learning patterns from vast amounts of data.
Generative AI is powered by advanced deep learning models, particularly foundation models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). These models are trained on massive datasets and use complex neural network architectures, including transformers, to understand context, patterns, and relationships within data. As a result, they can generate human-like responses and creative content across multiple domains.
The introduction of tools like ChatGPT in 2022 significantly accelerated global interest in generative AI, bringing it into mainstream use across industries. Today, organizations are increasingly adopting generative AI to enhance productivity, automate workflows, improve decision-making, and create personalized user experiences. While the technology offers substantial benefits, it also presents challenges related to accuracy, bias, security, and ethical use.
Overall, generative AI represents a major technological breakthrough that is transforming business operations, creative processes, and human-computer interaction worldwide.
Here are the basic concepts of Generative AI extracted and simplified from your text:
